Project: testInProgress_Extended
Authors: Adam Walls and Ricardo
Description: The testInProgress (TIP) plugin allows a user to view the status of their junit tests as they are run.
	     The extended TIP, upon seeing a failed test, allows a user to decide if they want to stop testing  or continue.
	     If the user selects to stop, it will simply exit execution of the junit tests.
	     If the user selects to continue, it will continue testing.
